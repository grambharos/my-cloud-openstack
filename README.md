# my-cloud-openstack

I have written a wrapper around the openstack cli commands.

## bin(openstack scripts)

* rc: loaded by default when the bin file is loaded
* flavors: os-flavor...
* images: os-image...
* instances: os-instance...
* projects: os-project...
* servers: os-compute..., os-hypervisor
* volumes: os-volume
* zone: os-zone
