resources:
  web_nodes:
    type: OS::Heat::ResourceGroup
    properties:
      count: 2
      resource_def:
        type: OS::Nova::Server
        properties:
          name: web-app-%index%
          key_name: mlopezc1
          image: ubuntu-14.04
          flavor: m1.small


outputs:
  first_address:
    value: { get_attr: [web_nodes, first_address] }
  networks:
    value: { get_attr: [web_nodes, networks] }
  float_ips:
    value: { get_attr: [web_nodes, networks, public, 1] }
    # try 0 instead


## output shows something like:


first_address
[
"192.168.120.5",
"192.168.120.4"
]

float_ips

--

networks
[
{
"public": [
"192.168.120.5",
"172.17.66.138"
]
},
{
"public": [
"192.168.120.4",
"172.17.66.137"
]
}
]


So, first_address worked, same for networks, but float_ips returns
nothing. Im basically trying to get the second ip from each server (in
the same output format that first_address)

Looking in the doc there a references about the usage of the
attributes in a ResourceGroup and that it should match to the internal
resources.

Also, looking at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/106542/ I see that
the code / functionality its suppose to be there in Juno.

Any ideas ? don't know what I'm missing here.
