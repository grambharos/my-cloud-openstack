1.Infrastructure as Code
=========================

Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

2.What is Terraform?
=====================

Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

In Simple,

Terraform is a tool for 

 i)   building, 

ii)  changing, 

iii) versioning 

 your infrastructure.



3.Use Cases :
=====================

1. Deploying and Maintaining Multi-Tier Applications Infrastructure (DB, WEB, LOG, Load balancer, etc)

2. Software Demos

3. Disposable Environments

4. Multi cloud Support (cloud agnostic)


4.Providers
============

Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers such as,

1) openstack

2) aws

3) google cloud

4) azure

5) kubernetes

6) DigitalOcean

7) .......etc......

5.Key Features
==============


Infrastructure as Code 
------------------------

a. Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax.

b. This allows versioning

c. infrastructure can be shared and re-used.



Execution Plans 
------------------------
Terraform planning step will evaluate and generates the execution plan. This shows what will be output ,when you apply this stack.



Paraller creation (Resource graph)
-----------------------------------

Parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources


Change Automation 
------------------

Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction

Incremental changes of your existing infrastructure can be updated.





6.Configuration File
=====================

Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.

As the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental execution plans which can be applied.
